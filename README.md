# Can't Unsee

## Learning Goals

- Identify common design mistakes

## Introduction

Design mistakes are everywhere. Once you start to see them, you'll never be able to _stop_ seeing them. This is good.

[Can't Unsee](https://cantunsee.space/) has dozens of tiny examples of design errors. You get to practice seeing them. It's like a game, where the prize is an eternity of noticing the design flaws in applications everywhere, forever.

Good luck.
